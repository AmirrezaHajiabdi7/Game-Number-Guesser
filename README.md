# Number Guesser Game
**Hello, I am Amirreza Haji Abadi.**

After about a month of serious learning Python, this is the first relatively structured project I've coded and tried to manage the project in a semi-professional manner.

This is a very simple game, the computer generates a number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess the number you want.

I used a scoring system for this game, so that you have 100 points at the beginning of the game, and if you can guess all the numbers, you will have 100 points left and you will be the **best player** in the world!


> **How do we run the game?**
The entire game structure is collected together in the file **main.py** and you just need to run **python main.py** in the terminal.
